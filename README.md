# Delaney ML Project for Molecular Solubility Prediction
## Overview
The Delaney ML Project is designed to predict the solubility of molecules, a crucial piece of information for chemists and biologists. This machine learning model utilizes a unique dataset that includes molecular descriptors necessary for determining whether a molecule is soluble in water or different solvents.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Delaney solubility dataset, which contains:
- Molecular descriptors
- Experimental solubility values

## Project Structure
- Import necessary libraris and load dataset.
- Data Preparation: Preparation of the dataset for modeling, including feature and target variable separation, followed by training and test set splitting.
- Model Building and Model Evaluation:
   - Linear Regression: Baseline model for prediction accuracy.
   - Random Forest: Advanced model for capturing complex patterns.
-  Evaluation of models using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
- Data Visualization
