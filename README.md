# Delaney ML Project for Molecular Solubility Prediction
## Overview
The Delaney ML Project is designed to predict the solubility of molecules, a crucial piece of information for chemists and biologists. This machine learning model utilizes a unique dataset that includes molecular descriptors necessary for determining whether a molecule is soluble in water or different solvents.

## Dataset

## Project Structure
Data Loading: Initial loading of the solubility dataset.
Data Preparation: Preparation of the dataset for modeling, including feature and target variable separation, followed by training and test set splitting.
Model Building:
Linear Regression: Baseline model for prediction accuracy.
Random Forest: Advanced model for capturing complex patterns.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of models using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
Data Visualization: Visualization of actual vs. predicted solubility values.
